You are given a crossword puzzle in JSON format.
The crossword consists of a grid and a set of clues (across and down). It also consists of length of each answer and the intersections.

Your task:

1. Solve all the clues.
2. The intersections in the input are all one-indexed with respect to the word
3. Return only a JSON object containing:

* `"solutions"`: all solved answers keyed by their clue number, separated into `"across"` and `"down"`.

Rules:

* Do not output explanations, reasoning, or extra text.
* Output strictly valid JSON that matches this schema:

{{
  "solutions": {{
    "across": {{ "clue_number": "ANSWER" }},
    "down":   {{ "clue_number": "ANSWER" }}
  }},
}}

Do not return ``` json ```. This is highly imperative.
Return **only** the JSON as text, as I want to convert it into a dictionary later on.
Example output:
{
  "solutions": {
    "across": {
      "3": "word3",
      "4": "word4",
      "5": "word5"
    },
    "down": {
      "1": "word1",
      "2": "word2"
    }
  }
}
