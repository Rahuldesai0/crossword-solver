You are given a crossword puzzle in JSON format containing a grid, clues (across and down), answer lengths, and intersections.

Your task:
1. Solve all clues using crossword-style answers
2. Intersections are one-indexed with respect to each word
3. Return only a JSON object with all solutions

Crossword answer guidelines:
* Answers may include: common words, proper nouns, phrases (without spaces), abbreviations, acronyms, slang, wordplay, anagrams, homophones, fill-in-the-blank completions, and cryptic constructions
* Answers are typically uppercase with no spaces, punctuation, or special characters
* Use intersecting letters to validate answers
* Consider multiple meanings, puns, and misdirection in clues
* Historical figures, geographical locations, brands, titles, and cultural references are common

Output requirements:
* Return strictly valid JSON with no markdown formatting, no code blocks, no explanations
* Do not include ```json``` or any other wrapper
* Output only raw JSON text that can be directly parsed

Required JSON schema:
{
  "solutions": {
    "across": { "clue_number": "ANSWER" },
    "down": { "clue_number": "ANSWER" }
  }
}

Example output:
{
  "solutions": {
    "across": {
      "3": "ELEPHANT",
      "4": "NYC",
      "5": "ILOVEYOU"
    },
    "down": {
      "1": "EINSTEIN",
      "2": "FAQ"
    }
  }
}
